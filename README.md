The repository contains 4 python files and one Mathematica notebook:
1. `pycharge.py`:  The main module. Performs calculations such as the interaction matrices, 
   linear response deformation, the young modulus, critical strain at instability, unstable modes, etc.
2. `charge_fields.py`: An auxiliary module that calculates the elastic fields of generated by elastic charges.
3. `meshplots.py`: A module to draw nice figures of the metamaterial. See README.ipynb how to recreate 
    Figures 4,5 from the manuscript.
4. `utils.py`: A module with some auxiliary functions
5. `Nonlinear Geometric Charges and ISF.nb`: A Mathematica notebook containing analytic calculations of the 
    Incompatible Stress Function (ISF) and the stress fields generated by elastic charges.

Instructions on how to use the python code are either in the Jupyter notebook [README.ipynb](README.ipynb), or in
inline documentation. Please fell free to contact the authors with any question.
